    <h3>Food Recomendations</h3>
    <p>The below table has the food recommedations in maryville city.
        My personal choice would be pizza which is available in pizza hut located opposite to shell petrol , orange juice at macey's is simply amazing which is made of fresh pulp and adundant in vitamin c. 
        For dinner white sauce pasta at A&G is just mouth watering its the chef's recommdation. I would suggest everyone to try these.

    <q>Firstly, consider the case when the segments are part of the same line. In this case it is sufficient to check if their projections on Ox and Oy intersect.
    In the other case a and b must not lie on the same side of line (c,d), and c and d must not lie on the same side of line (a,b). 
    It can be checked with a couple of cross products.</q>
