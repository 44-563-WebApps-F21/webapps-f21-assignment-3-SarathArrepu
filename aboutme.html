<h3>Captain Vanish</h3>
<p>Captain Vanish has inherited his powers in a lab accident.
    He is former scientist in Area 51 and while working on a gene that gives us inivisibility ,he accidently got exposed to the raditaion where one thing lead to another and he started to feel the difference where his body parts started to be inivisibile.
    Gradually he started to be inivisibile completely. But he can stay inivisible on for 3 hours in a stretch.
    There is a gradual decrease in his ablity to heal because of this power.
